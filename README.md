## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

Although I'm becoming more capable and gaining a greater understanding of the principals in the CSS Learning path I still struggle with media queries and mobile first workflows.  On this current project my media query isn't doing something as simple as changing the border-radius on my columns when shrinking the site to 768px.  Hopefully I'll fix this in the near futrure.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
